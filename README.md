# **Intermediate Python Solutions üêç**
Welcome to the repository containing solutions to the challenging exercises from **SoloLearn's "Intermediate Python"** lectures. In this collection, you'll find my interpretations and guidance on solving the tough questions provided at the end of each lecture.

## **Topics Covered:**
### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Explore the fundamental concepts of OOP, understanding how to design and structure code using classes and objects.

### 2. Classes
Dive into the world of classes, learning how to create and use them to encapsulate data and behavior in a modular way.

### 3. Inheritance
Discover the power of inheritance, a key concept in OOP, allowing you to create new classes based on existing ones.

### 4. Magic Methods & Operator Overloading
Uncover the magic behind Python's special methods and learn how to overload operators for custom behavior in your classes.

### 5. Data Hiding
Explore techniques for data hiding, ensuring that certain aspects of your class remain private and encapsulated.

### 6. Class & Static Methods
Learn the distinction between class and static methods, and how they can be used to manipulate class-level data.

### 7. Properties
Delve into the concept of properties, allowing for controlled access to class attributes and enhancing code readability.

## How to Use:
Feel free to leverage these solutions to enhance your understanding of intermediate Python concepts. Each solution is accompanied by my own interpretations and guidance **in _the comments_**, providing you with valuable insights.

## Contribution:
If you find areas for improvement or have alternative solutions, I encourage you to contribute to this repository. Let's create a collaborative space for Python enthusiasts to learn and grow together.

Happy coding, and enjoy your Python journey! üêç
